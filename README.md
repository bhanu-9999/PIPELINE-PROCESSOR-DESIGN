# DESCRIPTION: 
  A Pipelined Processor in Computer Science refers to a processor that uses the same control signals as a single-cycle processor, with control signals synchronized with data to improve performance by overlapping instruction execution stages. Pipelining is a technique for breaking down a sequential process into various sub-operations and executing each sub-operation in its own dedicated segment that runs in parallel with all other segments. The most significant feature of a pipeline technique is that it allows several computations to run in parallel in different parts at the same time. By associating a register with every segment in the pipeline, the process of computation can be made overlapping. The registers provide separation and isolation among every segment, allowing each to work on different data at the same time. An input register for each segment, followed by a combinational circuit, can be used to illustrate the structure of a pipeline organisation. To better understand the pipeline organisation, consider an example of a combined multiplication and addition operation.
